# _Activity Tracker_

## Description
This code simply keeps track of pressed buttons on the keyboard and mouse, as well as newly created or deleted files.

If you want, you can change the code a little bit, and it will also show modified files.

## What libraries do I need to put in?
Despite the fact that the code is not big, it uses as many as 4 third-party libraries(*keyboard, mouse, watchdog, colorama*).
Here are the codes to install them conveniently:
```python
pip install keyboard
pip install mouse
pip install watchdog
pip install colorama
```
(In principle, if you are not going to paint the font in any color, you don't have to use *"colorama"*.)
